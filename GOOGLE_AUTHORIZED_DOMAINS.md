## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Format:
- ‚úÖ **Correct:** `supabase.co` (domain only)
- ‚ùå **Wrong:** `https://supabase.co` (no protocol)
- ‚ùå **Wrong:** `jvpqalrnfyzsnqmtnqlf.supabase.co` (no subdomain)

### Why These Domains:

**1. `supabase.co`**
- Your OAuth flow redirects through Supabase's authentication system
- The callback URL is: `https://jvpqalrnfyzsnqmtnqlf.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- Adding the parent domain `supabase.co` authorizes ALL Supabase subdomains
- **This is the critical one** that fixes the login message

**2. `adaze.netlify.app`**
- Your production app domain
- Where users actually interact with your app
- Good practice to authorize your own domain

**3. `netlify.app`**
- Parent domain for Netlify sites
- Authorizes any Netlify subdomain you might use
- Useful for staging/preview deployments

## üéØ Expected Result

**Before (without authorized domains):**
> "You're signing back in to jvpqalrnfyzsnqmtnqlf.supabase.co"

**After (with authorized domains):**
> "Continue to ADAZE"

---

## üß™ Testing After Adding

1. **Click SAVE AND CONTINUE** in Google Console
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for changes to propagate
3. **Log out** of your app completely
4. **Clear browser cookies** (or use incognito mode)
5. Try **logging in with Google** again
6. Should now show: **"Continue to ADAZE"** ‚úÖ

---

## üîç Verification

To verify domains were added correctly:

1. Go back to **OAuth consent screen**
2. Scroll to **Authorized domains** section
3. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ supabase.co
   - ‚úÖ adaze.netlify.app
   - ‚úÖ netlify.app

---

## üí° If You Have a Custom Domain

If you've set up `adaze.com` (custom domain):

**Replace "Authorized domain 3" with:**
```
adaze.com
```

**Or add a 4th domain if Google allows:**
```
adaze.com
```

## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Q: Why do I need supabase.co?
**A:** Because your OAuth callback goes through Supabase's server (`jvpqalrnfyzsnqmtnqlf.supabase.co`). Without authorizing the parent domain, Google shows the full URL as a security warning.

### Q: Can I use the full subdomain?
**A:** Google only accepts the **parent domain** (e.g., `supabase.co`, not `jvpqalrnfyzsnqmtnqlf.supabase.co`). This is intentional - it authorizes all subdomains under that parent.

### Q: How long until changes take effect?
**A:** Usually **immediate**, but Google recommends waiting 2-5 minutes. Clear cookies or use incognito to see changes right away.

### Q: What if I still see the Supabase URL?
**A:** 
1. Make sure you clicked **SAVE AND CONTINUE**
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Clear all browser cookies
4. Try in a different browser or incognito mode
5. Verify domains were actually saved (check OAuth consent screen again)
