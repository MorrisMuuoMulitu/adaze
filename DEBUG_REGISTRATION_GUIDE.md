## 🎯 Common Issues & What to Look For

### **Issue 1: No Logs Appear**

**Symptoms:**
- Console is empty
- No 🎯 or 🚀 emojis

**Possible Causes:**
- Console is filtered (check filter dropdown)
- Need to refresh page after deployment
- Hard refresh: **Ctrl+Shift+R** (Windows) or **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac)

**Fix:**
1. Clear console filter (should show "All levels")
2. Hard refresh the page
3. Try registration again

---

### **Issue 2: Form Submits But No API Call**

**Symptoms:**
- You see: 🎯 [AUTH MODAL] Registration form submitted
- But NO: 📡 [AUTH MODAL] Sending registration request

**Possible Causes:**
- Form validation failed before submission
- JavaScript error stopped execution

**What to Check:**
- Look for red error messages in console
- Check if all form fields are filled
- Check password length (min 6 characters)
- Check passwords match

---

### **Issue 3: API Returns Error**

**Symptoms:**
- You see: ❌ [REGISTER API] Supabase signUp error
- Or: ❌ [AUTH MODAL] Registration failed

**Possible Causes:**

### **Issue 4: User Created But No Session**

**Symptoms:**
- You see: ✅ Supabase signUp successful
- But: session: 'No session'
- And: ⚠️ User created but no session (email confirmation required)

**Cause:**
Email confirmation is enabled in Supabase

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Find "Enable email confirmations"
3. **Disable it** (for testing)
   OR
4. Find "Auto Confirm Users" and **Enable it**
5. Try registration again

---

### **Issue 5: Profile Not Created**

**Symptoms:**
- You see: ✅ Supabase signUp successful
- But: ❌ Profile check error
- Or: ⚠️ No profile found for user

**Cause:**
Database trigger or policy issue

**Fix:**
1. Run `verify-registration-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Check if trigger exists: `on_auth_user_created`
3. Check if INSERT policy exists on profiles table
4. If missing, run `supabase-setup.sql`

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Now that logs are added:**

1. **Try registration** with the console open
2. **Read the logs** carefully - they tell the story
3. **Find the first error** (look for ❌ emoji)
4. **Copy the error message and context**
5. **Share the logs** so we can pinpoint the exact issue

### **What to Share:**

When reporting the issue, copy and paste:
- ✅ All logs from browser console (from 🎯 to 🏁)
- ✅ The error message (if any)
- ✅ Response status (200, 400, 500, etc.)
- ✅ Any warnings (⚠️) you see

### **Example Report:**

```
I tried registering and got this:

🎯 [AUTH MODAL] Registration form submitted
📋 [AUTH MODAL] Form data: { email: "test@example.com", role: "buyer", ... }
📡 [AUTH MODAL] Sending registration request...
📨 [AUTH MODAL] Response received: { status: 400, ok: false }
📦 [AUTH MODAL] Response data: { message: "User already exists" }
❌ [AUTH MODAL] Registration failed: { status: 400, message: "User already exists" }
🏁 [AUTH MODAL] Registration process completed

The error says user already exists, but I've never registered before!
```

This gives us ALL the context we need to help!
