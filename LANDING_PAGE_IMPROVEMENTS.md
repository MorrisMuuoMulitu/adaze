# 🎨 Landing Page & Navigation Improvements

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Navigation Menu Cleanup** 🧹

**Removed:**
- `/about` link (page doesn't exist - was causing 404)
- `/contact` link (simplified navigation)

**Current Navigation:**
- Marketplace (main shopping page)
- How it Works (scrolls to section)

**Result:** Cleaner, more focused navigation that doesn't confuse users with broken links.

### 2. **New Trust Badges Section** 🛡️

  - ❤️ Community Driven (verified sellers & reviews)
  - 🏆 Quality Guaranteed (curated items)
  - 🔒 Data Protection (encrypted platform)
  - 📈 Best Prices (competitive pricing)
  - 👥 10K+ Users (social proof)
  - ✅ Verified Traders (vetted sellers)

**Visual Design:**

### 3. **How It Works - Functional CTAs** 🎯

**Before:**
- "Start Shopping Now" - did nothing
- "Become a Trader" - did nothing

**After:**
- "Start Shopping Now" → Navigates to `/marketplace` ✅
- "Get Started" → Scrolls to top for signup ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `useRouter` hook
- Connected buttons to actual navigation
- Maintains smooth animations

### 4. **Landing Page Section Reorder** 📐

**Old Order:**
1. Hero
2. Stats
3. Featured Products
4. How it Works
5. CTA

**New Order:**
1. Hero
2. **Trust Badges** (NEW!)
3. Featured Products
4. How it Works
5. Stats
6. CTA

**Why:** 
- Trust badges immediately after hero builds credibility
