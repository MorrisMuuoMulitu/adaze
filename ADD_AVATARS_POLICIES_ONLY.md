## üí° What These Policies Do

- **UPDATE policy**: Allows users to replace their existing avatar image
- **DELETE policy**: Allows users to remove their avatar image

Both policies use `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text` to ensure users can only modify their own avatars (stored in their user ID folder).
