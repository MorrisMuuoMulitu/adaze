## 📋 How to Copy the Logs

### **Method 1: Copy from Console (Easy)**

1. Look for logs in the console with emojis:
   ```
   🎯 [AUTH MODAL] Registration form submitted
   📋 [AUTH MODAL] Form data: { ... }
   📡 [AUTH MODAL] Sending registration request...
   📨 [AUTH MODAL] Response received: { ... }
   ❌ [AUTH MODAL] Registration failed: { ... }
   ```

2. **Right-click** on any log line
3. Select **"Copy object"** or **"Copy"**
4. Or just **select all text** (Ctrl+A) and copy (Ctrl+C)

### **Method 2: Get from localStorage (If Page Did Refresh)**

Even if the page refreshes (shouldn't happen now, but just in case):

1. Open console (F12)
2. Type or paste this command:
   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('registration_debug_logs'))
   ```
3. Press **Enter**
4. You'll see ALL the logs!
5. Click the ▶ arrow to expand
6. Right-click → **"Copy object"**

### **Method 3: Console Screenshot**

1. Take a screenshot of the console
2. Make sure all error logs are visible
3. Scroll if needed and take multiple screenshots

  "error": "User already registered"
}
```

  "userId": "abc-123-def",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "session": "No session",
  "needsConfirmation": true,
  "message": "Please check your email to confirm"
}
```

### **Example 3: Database Policy Error**
```json

  "message": "new row violates row-level security policy",
  "code": "42501",
  "hint": "No policy allows INSERT on profiles table"
}
```

## 💡 Quick Tips

### **Tip 1: Clear Old Logs**
Before testing, clear localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('registration_debug_logs')
```

### **Tip 2: View Pretty Logs**
To see logs formatted nicely:
```javascript
console.table(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('registration_debug_logs')))
```

### **Tip 3: Save Logs to File**
To download logs as a file:
```javascript
const logs = localStorage.getItem('registration_debug_logs');
const blob = new Blob([logs], { type: 'application/json' });
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const a = document.createElement('a');
a.href = url;
a.download = 'registration-logs.json';
a.click();
```

### **Tip 4: Check Multiple Attempts**
Each registration attempt overwrites the previous logs.
So copy logs **immediately** after each failed attempt.

---

### **Issue 2: Modal Closes Immediately**

**Symptoms:**
