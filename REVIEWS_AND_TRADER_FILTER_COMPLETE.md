# Reviews & Trader Filtering - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Admin Dashboard - User Emails** ✅
**Problem:** User emails were showing as "N/A" in the admin dashboard under Users section.

**Root Cause:** The `get_user_emails()` database function had an incorrect signature (old broken version).

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive SQL fix in `fix-user-emails-admin.sql`
- Dropped all versions of the broken function
- Created correct function with proper signature: `TABLE(id uuid, email text)`
- Function now securely retrieves emails from `auth.users` table for admin users only

**How to Test:**
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to Admin Dashboard → Users
3. User emails should now display correctly
